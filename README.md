## Abstracts
> Hyperspectral video offers a wealth of material and motion cues about objects. This advantage proves invaluable in addressing the inherent limitations of generic RGB video tracking in complex scenarios such as illumination variation, background clutter, and fast motion. However, existing hyperspectral tracking methods often prioritize the material cue of objects while overlooking the motion cue contained in sequential frames, resulting in unsatisfactory tracking performance, especially in partial or full occlusion. To this end, this article proposes a novel hyperspectral video object tracker via fusing material and motion cues called SENSE that leverages both material and motion cues for hyperspectral object tracking. First, to fully exploit the material cue, we propose a spectral-spatial self-expression (SSSE) module that adaptively converts the hyperspectral image into complementary false modalities while effectively bridging the band gap. Second, we propose a cross-false modality fusion (CFMF) module that aggregates and enhances the differential-common material features derived from false modalities to arouse material awareness for robust object representations. Furthermore, a motion awareness (MA) module is designed, which consists of an awareness selector to determine the reliability of each cue and a motion prediction scheme to handle abnormal states. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-arts. The code will be available at https://github.com/YZCU/SENSE.
